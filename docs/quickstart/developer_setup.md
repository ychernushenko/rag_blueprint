# Developer Setup

This guide outlines the steps required to set up the RAG system on your local machine for development purposes.

Requirements:

- Python 3.12
- Docker

## Configuration & Secrets

The default configuration is located in `configuration.json`. This file configures Notion as the document datasource and defines default settings for embedding, augmentation, and evaluation stages. To customize the setup, refer to the configuration guide [Docs in Progress].

### Seccrets Configuration
Secrets are stored in the `env_vars/.env` file. Below is an example template:

```sh
# Datasources
RAGKB__DATASOURCES__NOTION__API_TOKEN=...

# LLMs
RAGKB__LLMS__OPEN_AI_LIKE__API_BASE=...
RAGKB__LLMS__OPEN_AI_LIKE__API_KEY=...

# Langfuse
RAGKB__LANGFUSE__DATABASE__USER=user
RAGKB__LANGFUSE__DATABASE__PASSWORD=password

RAGKB__LANGFUSE__SECRET_KEY=...
RAGKB__LANGFUSE__PUBLIC_KEY=...
```

- `RAGKB__LLMS__OPEN_AI_LIKE__*`: Required for connecting to the LLM, accessible via `RAGKB__LLMS__OPEN_AI_LIKE__API_BASE` and `RAGKB__LLMS__OPEN_AI_LIKE__API_KEY`. The LLM uses [TabbyAPI](https://api-docs.tabby.ai/) and integrates through the [OpenAILike](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/llms/openai_like/) client.
- **Langfuse Keys**: `RAGKB__LANGFUSE__SECRET_KEY` and `RAGKB__LANGFUSE__PUBLIC_KEY` are generated during initialization and will need to be updated later.

### Adjustments for Local Development

The default configuration assumes a Docker-based setup. For local development, modify the following parameters in `configuration.json`:

```json
{
    "pipeline": {
        "embedding": {
            ...
            "vector_store": {
                "host": "127.0.0.1",
            },
            ...
        },
        "augmentation": {
            ...
            "langfuse": {
                "host": "127.0.0.1",
                "database": {
                    "host": "127.0.0.1",
                }
            },
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Initialization

### Python Environment

1. Install uv on you OS following this [installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) guide.

2. In the root of the project, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```sh
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Services Initialization

To initialize the Langfuse and vector store services, run the initialization script:

```sh
build/workstation/init.sh
```

**_NOTE:_**  Depending on your OS and the setup you might need to give execute permission to the initialization script e.g. `chmod u+x build/workstation/init.sh`

Once initialized, access the Langfuse web server on your localhost (port defined in `configuration.json` under `pipeline.augmentation.langfuse.port`). Use the Langfuse UI to:

1. Create a user.
2. Set up a project for the application.
3. Generate secret and public keys for the project.

Add the generated keys to the env_vars/.env file as follows:

```sh
RAGKB__LANGFUSE__SECRET_KEY=<generated_secret_key>
RAGKB__LANGFUSE__PUBLIC_KEY=<generated_public_key>
```

## Development

### Running RAG

For the first run, it is recommended to execute the scripts in the specified order to ensure proper initialization of resources like vector store collections.

#### Embedding Stage

Run the embedding stage script:

```sh
python src/embed.py
```

**_Note_:** The embedding process may take significant time, depending on the size of your datasource.

#### Augmentation Stage

Run the augmentation stage script:

```sh
python src/chat.py
```

This initializes the RAG system's query engine and the Chainlit application, leveraging the embeddings generated in the previous step.

#### Evaluation Stage

Run the evaluation stage script:

```sh
python src/evaluation.py
```

**_Important_:** For evaluation to proceed, Langfuse datasets must be populated either manually or via Chainlit's human feedback feature. For additional details, refer to the [Docs in Progress].

## Git setup

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file configures code formatters to enforce consistency before committing changes. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, enable pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
```
